What the database needs to be able to do:
keep track of each user and their set of courses
needs to keep track of all courses, including their prefixes and course number

Idea:
create a table for the department for each course. It will have a serial for the id and a char for the course prefix (ex: 'COEN', 'ELEN', 'ENGL', etc.) 

create another table to keep track of the courses that are available. each course will consists of a name field (VARCHAR), and a Department tab(which maps to the department table)

create a 3rd table for the student. This tab will keep track of student information. The student will have a serial id, a name, and an email

finally, there will be a table for enrollment. each enrollment must have a unique (studnet, course) which will be used as the tables primary key.
